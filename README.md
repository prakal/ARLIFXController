Basic AR Controller
========

An augmented reality controller using awe.js, and the a W3C compliant browser. Use a print out of the image 64.png, and the camera should track its movement in 3D space. You can use a phone as well, but it doesn't work as well due to the glare. Demonstration GIF included below!
